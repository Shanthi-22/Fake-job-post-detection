# Fake-job-post-detection

**Overview**

This project aims to detect fake job postings using machine learning techniques. In recent years, fraudulent job advertisements have become increasingly common, deceiving job seekers and compromising their personal data. The goal of this project is to build a model that can automatically classify whether a job posting is genuine or fake based on various features extracted from the job description and metadata.

**Technologies Used**
	•Python for data preprocessing and modeling
	•	Pandas, NumPy for data handling
	•	Scikit-learn for machine learning models
 	•	VS Code for development
